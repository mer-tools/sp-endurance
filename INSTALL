INSTALLATION
============

For compilation to succeed, install XRes development headers:
 # apt-get install libxres-dev

And compile:
 $ make

Test:
 $ make test

Install (as root):
 # make install

If you need to be compatible with sp-endurance v3 (and earlier) executable
names, you can install compatibility symlinks:
 # make install-compat-symlinks

DESTDIR=<path> can be added to install line to change the
install prefix and DOCDIR=<path> to change documentation
path (differs between distros).

Post-processing tools have certain runtime dependencies.
To get them working, install the following packages:
 # apt-get install python lzop perl gnpulot-nox netpbm

To speed up endurance-report, install python-psyco
(Python "JIT" available for x86):
 # apt-get install python-psyco

To speed up endurance-plot, install the Inline Perl module (must be done before
building and installing sp-endurance):
 # apt-get install libinline-perl
